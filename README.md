Get the social network to social life.
We believe in a network of people that goes beyond virtual chatting and sharing of information.
Re-thinking the social network as an instrument to social life is our objective and we do it through playing along with the users in creating events where people actively can share skills, experiences and in person contribute to them.


The principle target market for users, then, should be in touristic areas [nearby hotels and hostels], as well as in the districts where there are more recent, young professional immigrants and national transplants.
Customer Segments:
Expats: Those starting over in a new country, looking to create a completely new social circle. They are also looking for “hotspots” where regular, interesting events may take place.

Tourists
Alternative and/or creative types (photographers, artists, musicians, singers, baristas, babysitters)
Flexible, non-traditional schedules
Disposable income available for socially significant events (bars, clubs, creative networking activities)
Our corresponding paying clients would be reasonably known bars, clubs, and artistic venues that can provide a niche and social milieu for the expat community.
Transplants: Those who are not looking to replace their original social circle to whom they’re still attached, but to enhance it with more local activities and activity partners.
Young, working age professionals (25-45)
Nationals with prior familiarity with the culture
More traditional working schedules (with traditional vacation time, as well)
Disposable income available for events, hobbies, and for moderate purchases
Our corresponding paying clients would be local life-style communities (yoga and “fashion fitness” businesses, hobby and craft centers, dance studios, seasonal and artistic events, etc.) and regular activity-based groups to provide routine activity to new transplants.
The savvy tourist: Tourist interested in alternative culture, “authentic” experiences, and off-the-beaten path excursions. They’re interested in meeting people in passing to share interactive and insightful experiences.
Adults of various ages (18-65)
Multi-culturally oriented (often, international travelers)
Limited time in town (looking for events within the day or the week)
Income available for “authenticity” or for “quality” experiences
Our corresponding paying clients would be small, under-promoted bars, cafes, restaurants, studios, and alternative-culture events which could provide local authenticity to non-traditional tourists.
The spontaneous socialite: Those proficiently popular individuals who juggle multiple social invitations per day. Not looking to expand their social circle, but not opposed to it. Interested in viewing instant events in their area.
Young (18-30): College students and creative types
They value spontaneity and enjoy managing a complicated social schedule
Incredibly flexible (if full) daily schedules; work optional
Limited disposable income available for socially significant events (bars, clubs, creative networking activities). Disinclined to select an expensive experience.
Often, the social hubs or the more socially influential in their social group.
Our corresponding paying clients would be medium-to-moderately-sized businesses which host events located in already popular areas; these events should be able to accommodate groups of attendees, as socialites tend to come in crowds.
Value Proposition per Customer Segment:
THE NEW-IN-TOWN: We provide information recommending local events and connecting them with local individuals who are interested in meeting others in their area. These members will be particularly interested in the events and locations which recur, as well as in meeting people who have already established themselves in the community – particularly their chosen creative or activity-related communities. 
The bars, clubs, and artistic venues that would provide a niche and social milieu for the expat community would grow a loyal customer base and reap a new crop of regulars who make that location their social home base.
TRANSPLANTS: The localized feature will most appeal to this group, who are looking to participate in local activities and to better know their area to which they’ve recently relocated. 
Our corresponding paying clients (local life-style communities and regular activity-based groups) would gain recurring customers who are looking to integrate that business or activity into their regular routine.
THE SAVVY TOURIST: To this group we provide authentic, non-traditional experiences which capture the essence of a community through interacting with community members. 
Small, local businesses appealing to this group would benefit in generating additional traffic through their doors and appreciative customers of their services. The client would not even need to offer discounts to attract their target user, as this user is in search of authentic experiences. 
THE SPONTANEOUS SOCIALITE: We offer the socialite a platform that supports their spontaneity and tells shows them instantly what is available around them. 
Clients targeting this group will become less anonymous in popular areas, will become a destination to head to rather than another place to pass by. They will also appreciate the number of people that socialites (local social hubs) will bring through their doors.
Customer Relationships:
Like many of our potential users, we are new to town and looking to connect with people and businesses in the area. We’re looking to establish real and long-term connections with the communities that we’re in, and we want to work with companies and with users to make sure those connections stay strong.
We help every potential business looking to participate as an advertiser or to attract our users through local events by first meeting with them to assess their needs and create reasonable targets and expectations for our mutual success. (Through such, we avoid the Groupon hangover of having too many people come through one’s doors or deals which just don’t catch on.)
After events, we work with our clients to reassess their needs and their success, and encourage them to adjust their user-targets accordingly. We offer discounts for relisting events to encourage our clients to use us again. We encourage our users to leave feedback for the event to measure and ensure that everyone in the Sharry community has benefit from the experience.
